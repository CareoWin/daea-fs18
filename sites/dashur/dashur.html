         <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>Dashur is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Archaeological site, for both the late Old Kingdom and the early Middle Kingdom periods. Located on the edge of Menshiyet City’s fertile zone, about 48km southwest of Cairo, Dashur is a royal necropolis complex with several examples of early pyramids, such as the Bent and Red Pyramids. The five pyramids present at Dashur illustrate the struggles that Pharaohs, such as Snefru, encountered while building their burial structures. The necropolis with the pyramids were intended as both symbols of a both a pharaoh’s symbol of political power and as religious pathways to the afterlife of their gods.

        <h3>REGIONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC SETTING</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

      <p>The large necropolis at Dashur is located about ten kilometers southeast of Saqqarah, which is also a major necropolis.  Dashur is situated across the Nile and west of Helwan, a large modern metropolis of the greater Cairo area, in the Upper Nile Region of Egypt. The modern city of Dashur is located across the Nile from Helwan, and is part of the Fertile Crescent that encompasses the Nile Valley in this region. Historically, the Dashur necropolis was part of Knife, the  22nd Nome of  Upper Egypt. The symbol for this region is a depiction of a knife. The region of the Dashur necropolis is considered to be a desert climate, with average daily temperatures in the nineties (Fahrenheit) during much of the year.  The Dashur necropolis is clearly demarcated by the sudden change in flora; within a few yards the lush greenery gives way to only sand. The three main remaining pyramids are located from approximately 1000 to 5000 feet from the edge of the fertile areas. The profiles of the remaining pyramids are the tallest structures within the necropolis.

        <h3>SITE DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


        <p>There are at least ten pyramids that have been found, ranging in condition from mostly intact to eroded to the point they are difficult to locate, within the Dashur necropolis area. The pyramids were built during two distinct periods, first in the late 3rd-early 4th dynasties, during the Old Kingdom Period, and then much later in the 12th and 13th dynasties of the Middle Kingdom period.  The necropolis also includes several mastabas  situated over shaft tombs, which date to the Old Kingdom period.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I. OLD KINGDOM</p>
        <p>The two most prominent pyramids at Dashur are the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid.  Both limestone pyramids were built during the reign of Pharaoh Sneferu, in the Old Kingdom period.  These two pyramids represent a transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth surface pyramids. The Bent Pyramid was constructed first; it has a distinctive change in the upward angles of its four corners halfway to the apex, making the top half of the pyramid appear to bend inwards upon itself.  The height of the Bent Pyramid is 344 feet with a base measurement of  617 feet per side. There is evidence that the stone blocks used to construct the pyramid were angled in such a way as to make the structure lean inwards. While it is also apparent that the Bent Pyramid was built on a less than an ideal foundation, thus causing the center of the pyramid to sink into the ground from its own weight, other popular theories abound as to what caused the “bend.” One such proposal is that Sneferu’s builders were in a “learning curve” when designing the prototype of later smooth-sided pyramids and realized when the pyramid was half built that the vertical angle of the four corners would have added considerable time to the labor required to finish the pyramid.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Red Pyramid was constructed after Sneferu was dissatisfied with the end result of the Bent Pyramid. Named the Red Pyramid for the rusty reddish limestone blocks that comprise the exterior today, the structure is the largest pyramid within the Dashur necropolis, and is exceeded in dimension and height only by two of the Great Pyramids of Giza.  The Red pyramid originally had a white limestone smooth exterior; these white stones were removed several thousands of years later and used in buildings constructed in Cairo.  The height of the Red Pyramid is 344 feet with a base of  722 feet on each side.
