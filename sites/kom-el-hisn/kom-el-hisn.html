         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Kom el-Hisn, the “Hill of the Fort” in Arabic, is an archaeological site located in Egypt’s Western Delta. It is thought to be the capital of the Third Nome of ancient Egypt, also known as the “Estate of Cattle”. This excavation found archaeological evidence that the site was occupied during the Old Kingdom, with a large community in the 4th – 6th Dynasties, and into the Middle Kingdom. This site has many large discoveries such as a large mud-brick temple, four statues of Ramesses II, the Tomb of Khesu-war, and over one thousand burials (Bard, 2005). Also found were the remains of cattle and an even higher amount of cattle dung used to fertilize plants. Since there was such a large amount of dung, this site might have been used to raise the cows that were later moved and consumed in larger cities.

<br>Flinders Petrie originally discovered this site in 1881, but his student Francis Ll. Griffith was the one to record information in 1885 and 1887. Griffith discovered the mud-brick temple walls that were dedicated to Sekhmet and Hathor. The next substantial excavation occurred in the 1940s by an Egyptian team when the burials were discovered after mud-brick tombs were brought to the surface after a heavy rain (Kirby, 1998). Most of the site has now turned into agricultural fields due to increasing urbanization of Egypt (Bard, 2005).

<h3>Introduction to Location</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Kom el-Hisn is in Lower Egypt’s Western Delta. It is about 90km from the current coastline of the Nile, but may have been as close as 50km during the Old Kingdom (Bard, 2005). It is located near the desert, the Delta, Libyan frontier, and the Mediterranean making it diverse for early socio-political systems (Wenke, 1988). It is west of the current city Tanta and south of the current city Damanhur.  Kom el-Hisn was the capital of the Third Nome during the Old Kingdom (Wenke, 1988). Kom el-Hisn was more forested than it looks like today because of agricultural expansion. The soil is sandy and not the most productive for agriculture. Cow dung was used to fertilize the soil for fodder crops, such as clovers, and other weeds (Bard, 2005). It is only a few meters above sea level; therefore Delta flooding affects the area greatly. The buildings are constructed of mud-brick walls and the statues were made of basalt.</p>

</figure> Kom el-Hisn is a large site about 1 mile by 1/3 mile. The first discoveries were made of Ramesses II statues. There were four statues in total near a pylon on the eastern end of the site (Cagle, 2001). At the northern end of the site, there were almost one thousand burials excavated. There is also a large limestone tomb of Khesu-war. Most of the burials were from the latter part of the First Intermediate period, but some Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom burials were also found (Cagle, 2001). This was realized because of the differences of pottery that were found within the graves. Lastly, there is a temple for the goddesses Hathor and Sekhmet. Inscriptions of the temple walls explain Hathor as the main deity of the time (Bard, 2005). </p>

<h3>Excavations - Past and Present</h3>
<hr>
<p>The first excavation of Kom el-Hisn happened due to Flinders Petrie discovering the statue of Ramesses II. His student, Griffith, returned and found a rectangular mud-brick temple with a thick pylon and four statues of Ramesses II within it (Kirby, 1998). These are not visible in today’s time. In 1910, a local antiquarian found the tomb of Khesu-war on the southwest corner of the site. C. Edgar found a basalt head of a twelfth dynasty king wearing a white crown and many cow bones at the north end of the site (Kirby, 1998). Next, the Egyptian team of Hamad, el-Amir, and Farid excavated the thousand burials in the 1940s after an antiquities director saw mud-brick walls after a heavy rainfall (Kirby, 1998). They dug up six test pits in order to find all of the walls to the Sekhmet and Hathir temple that Griffith originally spotted.
	<br>
	<br> In current research, there were three excavations during 1984, 1986, and 1988 focusing on the southern portion of the site (Cagle, 2001). This was thought to be the main areas of habitation with the most of the site being covered with ceramics. In 1984, they randomly selected test pits and trenches (Cagle, 2001). After looking at these results, in 1986 they decided to do a stratified random sample to clarify the structure of the site validly (Cagle, 2001). Finally, they performed one more excavation in 1988 to find more buildings and rooms. The artifacts discovered in this area of occupation were all used in basic household activities. Some artifacts that were found were bread molds, shallow bowls, jar, and ground stone tools (Cagle, 2001). Radio carbon dating found that most of these items were used in the 5th and 6th dynasties with some relating all the way to the Middle Kingdom (Wenke, 1988). There were also faunal remains of sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and fish (Cagle, 2001). The site is lacking in cattle bones with very few being found.</p>
