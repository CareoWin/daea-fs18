      <p>The Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter is located south of the Belizean capital of Belompan in central Belize.  Located near other rockshelters in the Caves Branch River Valley, but far from any major ancient Maya political entity, this rockshelter was most likely used by the rural agrarian communities that resided near in the river valley.</p>

      <p>Subterannean spaces were areas of great cultural importance within the ancient Maya cosmology, and still play roles in modern day rituals among Maya indigenous communities.  Though not technically subterannean in the same sense as a cave, rockshelters were still the locations of rituals, both funerary and non-funerary.  The presence of primary burials within the matrix of the Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter indicates that this space had some sort of mortuary component.  Based on the presence of mostly primary burials (modern looting has somewhat obscured this), it is likely that SUB functioned primarily as a genetically kin-based ossuary in a ritually and culturally charged space, intended to lay some sort of claim to the physical world while simultaneously utilizing the subterannean aspect of the lasndscape as a threshhold to the underworld.</p>
