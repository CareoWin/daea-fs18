      <h1>Buto/Tell el-Fara'in</h1>
      <h3>Predynastic to Late Period</h3>
	  <h4>By: Justin King</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The ancient, Lower Egyptian city of Buto, modernly known as Tell el-Fara'in, was the capital of the 6th Lower Egyptian Nome. 
  		    Originally, this city was actually two separate cities called Pe and Dep, that eventually merged into the large capital it was known to be. 
			Buto was perceived as the counter-part to the Upper Egyptian capital of Hierakonpolis because of their different theologies 
			and cultural beliefs, but played a pivotal role in the unification of Egypt. Today, this city is entirely buried under three separate mounds, with only Roman and
			Late Period reamains visible on the surface, so Tell el-Fara'in is normally translated to mean "mound of the pharoahs."  These mounds have been greatly excavated, revealing highly significant pieces of archeological evidence.  
			Tell el-Fara’in was first identified as Buto by Flinders Petrie in 1888, but not thoroughly excavated till the latter half of the 20th century when the Egypt 
			Exploration Society started projects there in the 1960s. The significance of their findings revealed both Ptolemaic and Roman activity at Buto during the Late Period.  It was not until  
			the German Institute of Archaeology started excavations at this site in 1983, that Predynastic remains were found located much deeper
			than previous excavations had dug.  Today, German excavations are still being done at Tell el-Fara’in, and they hold the most recent
			finds and evidence.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bayfield, Su, Tell el-Fara'in(Buto). Egyptian Monuments, Wordpress Web. accessed 6 Nov. 2016.">

			</figure>
			<p>The site of Tell el-Fara'in is regionally located northeast of the Nile Delta, and is about 60 miles east from the city of Alexandria.
			Surrounding the site, are both near and distant hills, patched with tall grass.  The terrain itself is quite soft, making excavating quite easy.  
			Given that Buto is located so close to the Nile River, it's clear that the annual floods would have molded the concentration of vegetation in and around
			the surrounding areas. Not only being one of the largest sites in the upper Delta, Buto is also known for being spatially consistent with the surrounding hills.
			Remains of Roman settlements are visible on the surface, and are essentially pocketed within the surrounding, elevated terrain.  Overall, the fact that the Nile floods influenced the landscape, 
			highlights the site of Buto as an area that showed changes in the terrain over long durations of time.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Hartung, Ulrich, Buto/Tell el-Fara'in,

		    <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content= "Breasted, James Henry, To Buto, (Tell El-Fara’in), (Archaeology of Ancient Egypt) Whatwhenhow Web. accessed 27 Oct. 2016.">Image 2</a> Map of Tell el-Fara'in, depicting the three separate mounds.</a></figcaption> 
            </figure>
			<p>Tell el-Fara'in is roughly one square kilometer in size and is split into two general hills, one in the north and one in the south.  The site also has a temple district 
			that is bordered by clay brick walls that still stand tall today.  The ancient remains that can still be seen on the surface, are mostly from the Roman times, but 
			remains from the 26th dynasty are also visible.  Any earlier evidence, such as predynastic or early Dynastic remains, are buried under several layers of sediment and some
			layers are beneath the groundwater level, making excavations increasingly difficult as depth increases.  When excavations reach the groundwater level, special pumps are used
			to keep the area relatively dry, and archaeological methods are then applied.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Hartung, Ulrich, Buto/Tell el-Fara'in, 
			German Archaeological Institute. Web. accessed 8 Nov. 2016.">(Hartung DAI)</a>  The diagram to the left depicts how Buto is spatially laid out. The three large mounds are labeled A, B, and C,
			where mound A and C are large settlement mounds, and mound B is the temple precinct, which contains all the visible, ancient remains on the surface.  The two settlement mounds are about
			twenty meters above the surface and the majority of the site is archaeologically stratified into seven layers that correlate with a time period.  The first two layers are actually the deepest 
			and they contain the remains of a Predynastic Lower Egypt.  Layers III, IV, and V correlate with the late Predynastic and Dynasty 0, while layer VI correlates with the early Old Kingdom.
			And the top layer, layer VII, contains the remains of the Late Period.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, Kathryn A, Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, Google Books.

			<p>Excavations at Buto have revealed a significant amount of evidence that has helped archaelogists paint a picture of what life was like, and how it changed over time in this
			ancient city.  Flinders Petrie was the first to determine the site as Buto, but the Egyptian Exploration Society was the first archaeological establishment to thoroughly excavate it.
			Their excavations revealed Roman and Late Period remains that were mostly found in the temple precinct, but Late Period remains were also found in the early strata of the southern settlement 
			mound.  In the temple precinct, several building remains were found, along with pottery ovens, and a noticeable bathhouse in the northeast corner of the site as well   It was not until the German 
			Archaeological Institute began excavating here in the 1980s, that older and deeper strata could be reached.  The GAI implemented a pumping system to remove the groundwater that prevented excavations 
			from reaching these earlier strata, in order to learn more about early life at Buto.  By using this method, they were able to reveal the first evidence of Lower Egyptian Maadi Culture, and early 
			Dynastic settlements as well.  The German Archaeological Institue holds the most research on specific excavations and they outline what they found in each strata.  Today, Ulrich Hartung leads the excavations 
			at Buto and has revealed how life changed over time at this site.
